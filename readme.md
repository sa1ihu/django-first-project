# django-first-project

this is my first full django project, built as part of the coursera django web framework course.

## features

- menu app with list and detail views
- templates with partials and inheritance
- models, urls, views, and admin setup
- built-in sqlite database
- clean project structure and best practices

## why this matters

this was the foundation of my django journey â€” the first time i brought together models, views, templates, and admin into one functional app.
